# Weather Twitter Bot
A twitter bot that takes a daily photo of the outdoors, overlays weather information, and sends it to Twitter.

This project uses a RTSP camera, the Twitter API, and the OpenWeather API to create an overlay of the temperature and weather, and post it to twitter on a regular basis.
